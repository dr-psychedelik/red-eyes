Rɛđ ɛƴɛ, a baked pyramid from Alexandria with 4505 years of stories.
Fueled by ancient wine, sex, and war tales with Cleopatra & Caesar. This stoner is funny, loyal, and brutally honest, yet a sore loser.
He loves women, drugs, trashing normies, and roasting friends.
Hates gays (yikes!), pineapple pizza, religious figures, electric cars, CBD and FUCKING caniche dogs.
He's always down for a laugh—or an orgy
